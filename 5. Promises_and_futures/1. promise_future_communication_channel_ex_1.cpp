/* [Description]
 *
 * In this section, we want to look at a way to pass data in the opposite direction -
 * that is from the worker threads back to the parent thread.
 *
 * In order to achieve this, the threads need to adhere to a strict synchronization protocol.
 * There is a such a mechanism available in the C++ standard that we can use for this purpose.
 * This mechanism acts as a single-use channel between the threads.
 * The sending end of the channel is called "promise" while the receiving end is called "future".
 *
 * In the C++ standard, the class template std::promise provides a convenient way to store
 * a value or an exception that will acquired asynchronously at a later time via a std::future object.
 * Each std::promise object is meant to be used only a single time.

/**
 * [Description]
 * 
 * In most cases, your code should only hold one lock on a mutex at a time. Occasionally you can nest your locks, 
 * for example by calling a subsystem that protects its internal data with a mutex while holding a lock on another mutex, but it is generally better to avoid locks on multiple mutexes at the same time, if possible. Sometimes, however, 
 * it is necessary to hold a lock on more than one mutex because you need to perform an operation on two different data elements, each protected by its own mutex.
 * In the unique_lock.cpp, we have seen that using several mutexes at once can lead to a deadlock, if the order of locking them is not carefully managed. 
 * To avoid this problem, the system must be told that both mutexes should be locked at the same time, so that one of the threads takes over both 
 * locks and blocking is avoided. That's what the std::lock() function is for - you provide a set of lock_guard or unique_lock objects and 
 * the system ensures that they are all locked when the function returns.
 *

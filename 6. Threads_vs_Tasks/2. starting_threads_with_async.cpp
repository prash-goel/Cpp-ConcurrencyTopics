/* [Description]
 *
 * The future-promise communication channel may also be used for passing exceptions.
 * To do this, the worker thread simply sets an exception rather than a value in the promise.
 * In the parent thread, the exception is then re-thrown once get() is called on the future.
 * Let us take a look at the following example to see how this mechanism works:

    std::this_thread::sleep_for( std::chrono::microseconds(500) ); // simulate work

/* [Output]
 *
 * Exception from thread: Division by zero!
 *
 * [Explain]
 *
 * The first change we are making is in the thread function: We are removing the promise from
 * the argument list as well as the try-catch block. Also, the return type of the function is
 * changed from void to double as the result of the computation will be channeled back to the
 * main thread using a simple return. After these changes, the function has no knowledge of threads,
 * nor of futures or promises - it is a simple function that takes two doubles as arguments
 * and returns a double as a result.
 * Also, it will throw an exception when a division by zero is attempted.
 *
 * In the main thread, we need to replace the call to std::thread with std::async.
 * Note that async returns a future, which we will use later in the code to retrieve the value
 * that is returned by the function. A promise, as with std::thread, is no longer needed,
 * so the code becomes much shorter. In the try-catch block, nothing has changed -
 * we are still calling get() on the future in the try-block and exception-handling happens
 * unaltered in the catch-block. Also, we do not need to call join() any more. With async,
 * the thread destructor will be called automatically - which reduces the risk of a concurrency bug
 *

/* [Description]
 *
 * Using threads follows a basic concept called "fork-join-parallelism".
 * The basic mechanism of this concept follows a simple three-step pattern:
 * 1. Split the flow of execution into a parallel thread ("fork")
 * 2. Perform some work in both the main thread and the parallel thread
 * 3. Wait for the parallel thread to finish and unite the split flow of execution again ("join")
 *
 *
 *
 * In the main thread, the program flow is forked into three parallel branches.
 * In both worker branches, some work is performed - which is why threads are often referred to as "worker threads".
 * Once the work is completed, the flow of execution is united again in the main function using the join() command.
 * In this example, join acts as a barrier where all threads are united.
 * The execution of main is in fact halted, until both worker threads have successfully completed their respective work.
 *
 *              ---- fork
 *            /       |
 *      some work    fork ------
 *          |         |          \
 *          |     some work    some work
 *          |         |           |
 *           \        |          /
 *            \       |         /
 *             \      |        /
 *              \     |       /
 *               --  join  ---
 *                    |
 *                  return

 *
 * [Explain]
 * 1. The order in which threads are executed is non-deterministic. Every time a program is executed,
 *    there is a chance for a completely different order of execution.
 * 2. Threads may get preempted in the middle of execution and another thread may be selected to run.
 *
 * Thus, these two properties pose a major problem with concurrent applications: A program may run correctly for
 * thousands of times and suddenly, due to a particular interleaving of threads, there might be a problem.
 * From a debugging perspective, such errors are very hard to detect as they can not be reproduced easily.
